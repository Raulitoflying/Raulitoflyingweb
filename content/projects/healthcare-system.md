#### Key Accomplishments:

- Architected a secure healthcare platform with Spring Boot and React/Vite, implementing **RESTful API principles** and **ACID** transactions in MongoDB to manage **500+** medical records and **1000+** appointments monthly with guaranteed data consistency.
- Engineered JWT-based authentication with OAuth2 Resource Server and **role-based access control**, ensuring **HIPAA-compliant** data protection while providing specialized interfaces for doctors, patients, and administrators.
- Leveraged Vite's development tools to accelerate build times by **78% (45s to 10s)**, resulting in improved developer productivity and sub-second rendering performance for end users.
