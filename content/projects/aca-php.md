## ACA: Highly Available PHP Application on AWS

Led the design and deployment of a PHP application using Docker on AWS (EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling), achieving high availability (99.9% uptime).

### Key Features

- Integrated MySQL via RDS and secured credentials with Secrets Manager, reducing response time by 30% during high-traffic scenarios
- Streamlined infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines, reducing setup time by 60% and enabling 150% scalability
- Built real-time monitoring dashboards using CloudWatch and Tableau to visualize system metrics and performance trends

### Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Core programming language
- **AWS Cloud**: Hosting platform
- **EC2**: Compute instances
- **ELB**: Load balancing
- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamic resource scaling
- **RDS (MySQL)**: Managed database service
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure credential management
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated deployment
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring solution
- **Tableau**: Visualization tool

This PHP application demonstrates best practices in cloud architecture, infrastructure automation, and performance monitoring to achieve high availability in production environments.
